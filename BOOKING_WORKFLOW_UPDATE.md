# Booking Workflow Update

## Overview

The booking workflow has been updated to include a new intermediate status "Done" between "Approved" and "Completed". This ensures proper workflow control where the admin must approve bookings, employees mark them as done, and then admins can complete them.

## New Workflow

### 1. Admin Approval

- **Status**: `Pending` → `Approved`
- **Action**: Admin clicks "Approve" button
- **Result**: Booking is approved and assigned to an employee
- **UI**: Shows "Approved - Awaiting Employee" badge

### 2. Employee Completion

- **Status**: `Approved` → `Done`
- **Action**: Employee clicks "Mark as Done" button
- **Result**: Employee indicates work is completed
- **UI**: Shows "Done - Awaiting Admin Review" badge

### 3. Admin Final Completion

- **Status**: `Done` → `Completed`
- **Action**: Admin clicks "Complete" button
- **Result**: Booking is fully completed
- **UI**: Shows "Completed" badge
